It's been a while! The old blog is broken while I updated the software, but for now I've plumped for a good old WordPress install.

A lot's happened since the last post on the old blog, which was posted just before I went to Cardiff to watch the All Blacks choke in the World Cup semi final.

Well New Zealand just beat Ireland on the weekend in their first game since the ill-fated World Cup campaign. The ABs are back on the horse, so it's fitting that I fire up the blog again as well.

I'll try to post often, even if it's inane or just sharing content, and maybe get a chance to go back over what's been happening here.
