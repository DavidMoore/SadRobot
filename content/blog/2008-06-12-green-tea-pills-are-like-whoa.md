title: Green Tea Pills are like, whoa

So my workmate offers me a green tea pill this afternoon. I like green tea, and a green tea pill sounds healthy and good enough (if not a strange way to be getting your green tea).

He then checks on the bottle, and notes a warning saying "Do not take after 4pm" and tells me about it _after_ I've already downed the pill.

Turns out the pill has got caffeine, guarana and every other possible legal stimulant and anti-oxidant you could name.

It's just after 11pm now and I feel like I could stay up for another 5 hours.

Well, at least the buggers work. I'll just try to make sure if I try one again, it's in the morning.
