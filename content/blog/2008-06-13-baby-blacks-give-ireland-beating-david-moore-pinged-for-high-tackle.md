The New Zealand Under-20 rugby team is playing in the inaugural IRB Junior World Championship and just thrashed Ireland 65-10.

I watched some of the coverage at the TVNZ site (they have full footage of both halves <a title="New Zealand Under 20 versus Ireland" href="http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/536641/1841810" target="_blank">here</a>).

There was a flanker playing for Ireland called David Moore. While I skipped through the video I managed to see him give away a couple of penalties, including for a blatant head-high clothes-hanger tackle. Good stuff, repping the David Moore name!

While it's good to see the rough stuff still in rugby, these transgressions might be brought up at the next annual David Moore Secret International Underground Society meeting. Think of a cross between Freemasons & Illuminati, except the membership is even more exclusive (with the first criteria being you need to be called David Moore).
