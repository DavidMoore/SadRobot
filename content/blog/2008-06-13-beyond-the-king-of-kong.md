If you haven't watched The King of Kong, I highly recommend it.

It's a documentary about 2 men from entirely different backgrounds and circumstances facing off for the world record of the classic arcade game Donkey Kong. It might sound boring, but it's 1% about the game, and 99% about human behaviour, obssession, celebrity, redemption, underdog versus establishment. Very entertaining and rivetting. (97% rating on Rotten Tomatoes)

Anyway, I can't get over the fact that the "villain" of the documentary &#8211; Billy Mitchell &#8211; reminds me so much of Michael Scott from The Office. If not for the fact that The Office has been around longer than The King of Kong, I would swear that Steve Carell based so many of Michael Scott's mannerisms off Billy Mitchell.

Watch this interview with Mitchell and see if you agree.
