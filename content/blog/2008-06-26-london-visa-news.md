News on the London front! I still have quite a few months left on my visa, but my 12 months of allowed work are nearly used up. This means I can still stay in London but won't be allowed to work.

My job wants to keep me on, so I will basically have to come back to NZ for a short time soon. From there, work will arrange sponsorship for me, and I will then re-enter London on a work visa that lasts for up to 2 years and is then renewable.

So, I will be coming back in the next month or 2, provided the money situation at work gets sorted out. This time I will try to arrange to stay for at least 2 weeks to make the trip worthwhile.

I will keep things up to date once I get some more money and can choose some dates and book flights.
