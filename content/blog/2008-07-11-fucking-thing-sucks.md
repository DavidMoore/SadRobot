You've probably already seen the infamous Bill O'Reilly flips out video. If not, here it is:



There's some pretty funny remixes of it too.

**Bill O'Reilly's Producer**

One of the intriguing things about the original is thinking how people react off camera and deal with the irrate O'Reilly. You hear a little bit of the producer on the original, but you still have to wonder how he manages the man day to day, and somehow gets O'Reilly to actually finish the piece. This video riffs on that.



**Dance Remix**

Catchy profanity



**Playing Battle Toads**

This is a notoriously difficult old Nintendo game. This video is eerily close to how I play video games.
