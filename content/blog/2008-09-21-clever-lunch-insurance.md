I've never been one to pack a lunch for work, especially sandwiches (MEH @ sandwiches). So noone's ever stolen my lunch from the office fridge, but then I don't know who does those kinds of things.

Someone's come up with a very simple but effective deterrant: a sealable lunch bag with a mould print on it.<figure style="width: 640px;" class="wp-caption alignnone">

The makers seem to want to charge money for this, but you can probably make your own very easily.

This could backfire if someone tries to do a fridge clean-out and chucks your tasty sandwich because it's gone mouldy.
