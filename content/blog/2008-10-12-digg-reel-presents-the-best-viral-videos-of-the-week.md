<a title="The Digg Reel" href="http://revision3.com/diggreel/" target="_blank">The Digg Reel</a> is a show over at "Internet Television" site Revision 3.

They find the most popular videos posted on digg.com and package them together in a little hosted show. They even pick out some of the choicest user comments on the videos, reference other videos, and occasionally some pretty terrible but funny special effects and gags of their own.

While you might already have seen some of the videos during the week if you haven't been hiding under a rock, you'll at least be sure you're not missing out on any of the viral videos of the moment.

It's nice to be able to sit back with some food and drink and get someone to show you all the videos without lifting a finger. Now if only it could be a bit longer.
