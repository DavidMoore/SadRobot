I'm currently using ASP.NET MVC to build the next-gen version of my CMS/App Framework Orange.

I've been using CodePlex community builds, but MVC has finally gone to Beta. I'm just now in the process of fixing my code to go with the minor breaking changes in the beta.

I'm really liking many things about MVC so far, but a review of MVC is another blog post for the future.
