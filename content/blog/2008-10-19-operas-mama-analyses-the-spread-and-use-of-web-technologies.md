The Opera guys have created a project called **MAMA** &#8211; "Metadata Analysis and Mining Application". It is designed to trawl the web and analyse what technologies and techniques are actually being used in web pages.

Their intial study results are in, taken from 3 and a half million URLs.

Interestingly, tables are still right up there with most popular tags, suggesting there are still a lot of people using tables for layouts, particularly when you see this quote:

> "Tables: TABLE, TR, and TD all used. Tables typically nested 3 levels deep."

Font tags are also still very popular.

It's hard to tell at this point if this is because those pages are old, or if new sites are still using this style of markup.

Some more findings:

  * A little over 4% of the pages passed W3C HTML validation
  * A third of the URLs used Flash. The lowest regional use of Flash is 25%, meaning at least 1 in 4 pages use Flash.
  * Nearly 3/4 of the URLs used javascript in one form or another
