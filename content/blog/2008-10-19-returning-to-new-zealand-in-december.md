Talking to the flatties, everyone's quite keen to come back to New Zealand a few months earlier than our visa expiration.

Aaron and Renee want to get back for a wedding and their legendary gran's birthday.

This suits me, as I'm broke, and won't achieve anything staying here much longer.

I will settle on a date soon so I can book the flight. I'd like to come back for xmas for sure.

As far as short and mid-term plans go, that's as far as I've gotten for now.

To be honest I'm really looking forward to seeing everyone again and enjoying the Auckland summer.

I'm not sure where I will be staying when I come back. My mum is still well outside Auckland so I won't be able to stay there for long (not to mention no Internet). I have a friend with a spare room on the 'Shore, so I'll probably end up there temporarily.

I can't wait to see everyone again!

P.S. someone please save me a packet of Snifters.
