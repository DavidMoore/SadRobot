Elinor and Julia visited from New Zealand, and we went to Paris and hung out in London for a few days. I've posted some photos on Facebook but I'll try to blog something about it at some point. Was good fun, and nice to see Els and get some travel done (even if it was to Paris again).

So I'm ready to get cracking into work again and get prepared for my return to New Zealand which is really only weeks away.
