<a title="Opera 10 Alpha" href="http://www.opera.com/browser/next/" target="_blank">Opera 10 Alpha is out!</a>

Apart from it being an updated and faster engine, it also adds 100% ACID3 support, HTML Email Composition (finally!), integrated spell checker, and automatic updates.

All this on top of the in-built features like mouse gestures, integrated ad blocker, the slick mail, news feed and chat client, Bit Torrent support, Wand password manager, desktop widgets etc.
