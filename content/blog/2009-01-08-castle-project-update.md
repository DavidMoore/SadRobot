Hamilton has applied a bunch of patches and fixes to the Castle Project for the Components and Windsor sub-projects. Including 2 minor and insignificant patches that I submitted +D. It's good to feel part of a major Open Source project, even for a small contribution.

While I'm currently focusing my efforts on ASP.NET MVC and moved away from MonoRail, I use Castle extensively in my .NET projects, particularly ActiveRecord and Windsor/MicroKernel.
