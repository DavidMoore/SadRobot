If you've had a dog you'll know how they often twitch and move their limbs in their sleep. Well, this dog is like that but on a whole other level. Must have scared the crap out of the owners the first time she did this. How about sleep barking? Sleep running in circles Imagine if the dog was narcoleptic too
