Here's the article I followed to create my bootable USB flash drive when installing Windows 7 - something that's essential when you don't have a floppy drive or an optical drive in your machine. <a title="Creating Bootable Vista / Windows 7 USB Flash Drive" href="http://kmwoley.com/blog/?p=345" target="_blank">http://kmwoley.com/blog/?p=345</a> To make the process even simpler, you can use WinRAR or an ISO-mounting or reading application to get the installation files and boot sector from the Windows 7 RC1 ISO image without needing to burn a DVD.
