Opera has built-in torrent support which is very handy and nice, but not quite as nice as a full-fledged client like <a title="µTorrent - The Lightweight and Efficient BitTorrent Client" href="http://www.utorrent.com/" target="_blank">uTorrent</a> To disable the Torrent support in Opera so that uTorrent or your default torrent client will be used instead: <ol> <li>In Opera, type in <em>opera:config</em> in the address bar and hit enter</li> <li>Click the Bit Torrent section to expand it</li> <li> Untick <strong>Enable</strong></li> <li> Hit <strong>Save</strong></li> <li>Click OK at the message box</li> </ol> You won't have to restart Opera for this change to take effect
