[Opera 10.5 Beta](http://www.opera.com/browser/next/) is out and it's very impressive, and looks pretty stunning due to its Windows 7 integration.

One thing I don't really like is how it shows all the tabs using Aero Peek when you click it in the Task Bar.

You can turn this off:

  1. Type "opera:config" in the address bar and hit Enter
  2. Scroll down to User Prefs and expand it, or type in "Windows 7&#8243; in the search box
  3. Untick the "Use Windows 7 Taskbar Thumbnails" setting
  4. Click Save
  5. Restart Opera
