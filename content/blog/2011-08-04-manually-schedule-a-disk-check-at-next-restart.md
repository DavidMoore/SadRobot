You can schedule a chkdsk at reboot time for a drive by using the Windows command line utility [fsutil](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/fsutil.mspx "FSUtil @ microsoft.com").

You do this by setting the "dirty" flag for a drive, which marks the drive for a chkdsk when you next reboot.

Usage:

> <pre>fsutil dirty query &lt;volume pathname&gt;</pre>

e.g.

> <pre>fsutil dirty set <strong>C:</strong></pre>

You can check if a drive has been marked as dirty by using the query command:

> <pre>fsutil dirty query &lt;volume pathname&gt;</pre>
