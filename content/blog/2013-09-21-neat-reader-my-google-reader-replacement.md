I already had the idea of writing my own feed reader on my list of things to do, so when news came out that Google were phasing Reader out, it naturally became my next hobby project.

Only spending a few hours here and there over several months, I’ve personally been using it since Google Reader died.

Only in the last few weeks has it been fit for human consumption (or even gotten a proper name).
