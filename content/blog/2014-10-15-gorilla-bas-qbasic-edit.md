Nostalgia time!

Back when I got my first PC, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic" target="_blank">QBasic</a> was part of the operating system.

I spent hours and hours playing around with QBasic and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS_Editor" target="_blank">MS-DOS Editor</a> (or simply _edit_ as we all knew it) to see what graphics and games I could whisk up.

There was a game that came with QBasic and MS-DOS called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorillas_%28video_game%29" target="_blank">Gorillas</a>, which was effectively like Worms and Scorched Earth.

Look at those mind-blowing graphics!

Man, have editors and IDEs come a long way; but edit was a great editor for its time. What a twinge of nostalgia I feel when I see this screen:

Edit came along for the ride all the way to Windows 7; but sadly, it doesnâ€™t come with any 64 bit OSes.

RIP, old friend.
