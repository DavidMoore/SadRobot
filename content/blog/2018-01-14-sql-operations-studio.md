## SQL Operations Studio Released

Microsoft recently released a preview of a free, new SQL management suite called SQL Operations Studio.

It is obviously based on Visual Studio Code, so is extensible and scriptable, and potentially the SQL Operations Studio features may be added to VSCode later.

The product already has an incredibly useful, customizable dashboard feature, as well as support for viewing SQL Query Plans and Execution Plans.

There is also a connection manager that handles Azure connection. You can also save result sets in JSON.

I can absolutely see myself using this more often than SQL Management Studio.
