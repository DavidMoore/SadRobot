# Windows

## NVIDIA & G-Sync

* Disable v-sync in NVIDIA Control Panel and In-game (reduce input lag)
* Enable G-Sync
* Limit in-game FPS to 3 frames below the max refresh rate of the monitor
* Max pre-rendered frames: 1 (minimum). If CPU seems to be struggling, try setting to 2 and see if framerate is smoother without introducing input lag.
* Disable triple-buffering

## Power and Sleep settings

* Use the High Performance plan if possible
* Check Processor Power Management
  * Minimum processor state: **100%**
  * System cooling policy: **Active**
  * Maxmimum processor state: **100%**

If you want to use more efficient power settings, you can disable the core parking by using an application such as Park Control

# Mouse

Logitech:

* Set max polling rate to 1000Hz
