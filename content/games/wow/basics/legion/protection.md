## Rotation

#### Survivability

* Use Shield of the Righteous to get your active mitigation up.
* Make sure you're standing in Consecration for extra benefit (also more if you wear legendary ring)
* Cast Judgement first to buff the next Shield of the Righteous
* You can cast SoTR a few times in advance to buy you some time if you're not going to be in melee range of a target
* Avenger's Shield can keep a reasonable absorb shield up on you
* If Judgement crits, it will lower the cooldown on the next SoTR
* If you have Righteous Protection, Judgement will lower the cooldown on next HoTP

#### DPS

* Stack Seraphim with wings, and Eye of Tyr if you have shoulders
* Keep Consecration up
* Avenger's Shield if it's off cooldown
* Judgement to possibly proc AS if you chose Crusader talent
* Otherwise, Blessed Hammer / Hammer of the Righteous for damage and chance of proccing AS
* SotR for additional DPS if it won't be needed, or don't need charges for Seraphim yet

# Ability Combos

You can stack core spells with cooldowns to increase your ability to take extremely large hits that might otherwise kill you.

This usually involves having up SoTR with one of AD or GoAK.

Eye of Tyr can be used as another combo with SoTR, or can also be stacked with AD or GoAK for particularly big hits.

Being able to intelligently rotate your combos with your immunities will allow you to endure high stacks of tank debuffs, a series of high-burst attacks, or survive what should be a one-shot.
