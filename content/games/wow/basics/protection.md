## Rotation

Judgement > Avenger's Shield > Hammer of the Righteous

#### Survivability

* Shield of the Righteous is your active mitigation; it is now armor only (physical)
* Make sure you're standing in Consecration for damage mitigation
* Casting Avenger's Shield will buff your next SotR
* HotP is your self heal
* Seraphim has something of a defensive benefit now that SotR is physical only but should still be considered a DPS talent
* For magic damage, you will need a cooldown (Ardent Defender, Guardian of Ancient Kings, Bubble taunt)
* Talent Spellwarding for magic immunity

#### DPS

* Coming soon
