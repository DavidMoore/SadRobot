The Sand Queen

When you have big arrow on your head, go away from friends. Dont walk into stuff she spawns on the ground. Kill adds quickly.

Jes Howlis

When he starts casting Flashing Daggers go behind a wall. When he runs away follow him and finish him. Use your stuns / slows on adds.

Kingh Captain Valyri

If you have red fire dot on you, dont go near barrels, you will explode them. If you don't have it on you, try to move some barrels so your party has some space to stand when she will make them explode.

Overseer Korgus

When you move, your bar fills up. When your bar is filled up, you are stunned for 10 seconds. Avoid black aoe on the ground. Cannons on the side will charge a shot, don't go in front of it. Move away from allies when you have the orange circle on you so circle doesnt reach them.
