Heartsbane Triad

One of the 3 bosses will be bigger than the others. Do damage to this one. Then it will change. So change target, you need to hit the one that is bigger than the others always. Keep moving when you have shadow dot on you to avoid stacking it.

Soulbound Goliath

When he imprisons one of your friends kill the thing. Don't stand on the fire. If you're a tank, when boss reaches high stacks you might wanna pop defensive CDs or kite him. If you kite him, make him walk into the fire on the ground.

Raal the Gluttonous

Stand on his side. Slow the servants trying to reach the boss.

Lord and Lady Waycrest

When she drops the bass, move away from things on ground. When you have dot on you, move away from friends because you will leave a pool of poison on the ground. Don't stand on that.

Gorak Tul

Kill adds before they cast Death Lens. Pick up molotovs to burn their bodies so Gorak can't rez them all at once.
