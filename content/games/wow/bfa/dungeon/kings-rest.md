* Use Blessing of Spellwarding or Divine Shield to break the fear

The Golden Serpent

When you have orange DOT on yourself go away from boss it will make a pool appear beneath you at the end of the DOT, try to stack those pools at the same place, important cause thats where the adds will come from, don't let adds reach boss, use your slows and stuns, dont stay melee range when boss is doing tornado around him

Mchbimba the Embalmer

Spread out so eveyrone is in decently close to a crypt, dont stand in big fire, when he entomb someone watch the crypts, if the crypt is shaking and making noise click on it.

The Council of Tribes

Avoid big flying axes, when he starts charging someone, go stand inbetween boss and guy whos being charged, kill totems (explosive totem first), interrupt Poison Nova.

Dazar, the First King

Avoid tornado, spread out so you don't get damaged when he jumps on someone. When stuff starts falling on the ground go counter clock wise fast so you go past it, dont try to outrun it, go the other way.
