Hit the one that doesnt have Lightning Shield (it will change so be careful), if you have electricity debuff on you go away from friends, spread out when he is doing ninja electricity charge.

Merektha

Don't stand in green poo, turn your character 180 degrees when he's about to blind you, kill serpents that are imprisoning your friends (or stun the serpent sack, it will remove it, thanks for the heads up u/ElementaryMyDearWut), when he is burrowed avoid him.

Galvazzt

Pillars will appear. Go stand between boss and pillar so he doesnt gain energy. This will stack a debuff on you. If you have more than 10 stacks stop standing between him and pillars and/or use defensive CD to remove stacks (iceblock, maybe cloak for rogue not sure about that).

Dont click on green orb before everything is dead. Kill heart guardian, interrupt Plague doctor, don't stand in blue light on the ground. If Healer, don't touch frogs they will lower your heals (thanks u/Redruddc)
