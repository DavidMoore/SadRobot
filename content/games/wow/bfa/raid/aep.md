* Weapons can only Warforge (+5 or +10)
* Azerite Armor cannot Warforge or Titanforge

# Abyssal Commander Sivara

* Blessed Hammer for DPS, Holy Shield to mitigate the debuff ticks
* **Heroic**Frozen Blood: jump up and down on spot to prevent Frozen, Venomous Blood: stay still to prevent Delirious
* Use mitigation for Crushing Reverberation; you should be able to solo soak this with cooldowns. Could also BoP taunt.
* Taunt swap after Crushing Reverberation

# Blackwater Behemoth

* Taunt swap as your healing debuff is about to expire
* Spec Spellwarding to use on other players if their healing buff runs out, or on yourself to immunity the DoT
* Slipstream Generator (blue punchcard) increases your swimspeed
* You can use BoP or DS to immune Gaze from Below when swimming between platforms

# Radiance of Azshara

* Taunt swap on Tide Fist. You can taunt while Tide Fist is being cast and it will still hit the other tank
* Squall traps can be cleared with Spellwarding or DS
* Keep the Stormwraith interrupted with AS and Rebuke
* Tank the Stormwraith as close to an edge as possible, to give people room for the knockback

# Lady Ashvane

* Spec Blessed Hammer (boss melees)
* Waves can be soaked with DS or SW
* If you're dedicated soak tank, spec Holy Shield, Spellwarding
* Barnacle Bash can be blocked, or taunt + BoP if you have high stacks
* You can DS out of Briny Bubble, or Divine Steed + Conflict and Strife Major Essence

## Rippling Wave Soaking

* Absorbs are good! Bulwark of Light trait (throw Avenger's Shield at boss as much as you can); Court trinket (set to Sea Witch magic absorb); Frost-laced Prism from Opulence?
* Get frost-damage reduction Benthic cloak Shirakess Drape (3% frost damage reduction)
* Spec into Holy Shield, Blessing of Spellwarding
* Aegis of Light as another cooldown for when you let bubbles hit when the carapace is down. Otherwise, Judgement of Light
* Seraphim + Unbreakable Spirit or Hand of the Protector + Righteous Protector
* Can use Cyclotronic Blast trinket to help with pushing, especially if you specced Seraphim. You can use at start of fight and near the end of phase 2.
* Major Essences: Azeroth's Undying Gift can be used often; Vision of Protection viable especially with Righteous Conviction; Crucible for self heals or pushing dmg; Lucid
* Don't use majors: Nullification Dynamo's cooldown is way too long, and the absorb too small
* Minor: Nullification Dynamo will help. Conflict and Strife if you have rank 3; Worldvein, Lucid, Crucible?
* Engineering Helm trait Cauterized can provide HPS
* Holy Shield does a lot of work here, as it lets you block and mitigate the Waterlogged debuff. It will easily top your healing.
* When not soaking, stand in your Conseration for the damage reduction. Maybe you could stack Mastery to buff this?
* Swap out Haste/Crit rings for high-Versatility rings
* Azerite Traits: Undulating Tides (absorb when you drop below 50%, 45 sec cooldown)

# Orgozoa

* Use Blessed Hammer (all auto attacks)
* When taking Orgozoa with no stacks of Desensitizing Sting, use SoTR + (AD / GoAK / essence or trinket mitigation)
* Desensitizing Sting goes through immunities
* Amniotic Splatter must be solo soaked by tank or someone with immunities
* Phase 2: Use Avenger's Shield to interrupt Azsh'ari Witch's Conductive Pulse to stop raid-wide 3 sec stun
* Tank Swap Phase 1: 6/7/7/7/7 stacks
* Tank Swap Phase 2: ~7-9 stacks
* You can soak Amniotic Splatter with DS or SW even if you have no stacks
* Phase 2: You can solo soak the Powerful Stomp with SW, DS or GoAK

# The Queen's Court

* Blessed Hammer
* Can use SW on the Pashmar tank when Zealous Eruption is cast
* SW can be used to immune the last tick of Deferred Sentence, and also allow a player to solo soak Frenetic Charge (Frost)
* Repeat Performance: You can use Cleanse, Rebuke or even Contemplation as fillers
* Don't waste LoTP when Obey or Suffer is on you, due to reduced healing

# Za'qul

* Ideally you should be off-tank due to Prot Paladin magic mitigation
* Main Tank: Blessed Hammer, Off-Tank: Holy Shield
* Use Null Barrier Minor (at least)
* You can use SW to take no damage from Mind Tether
* Off-Tank: Taunt adds as often as you need. Consider First Avenger for more Avenger's Shield.
* Blessed Sacrifice on Main Tank will reduce damage on both tanks

# Queen Azshara

* Go Holy Shield due to high magic damage from Aethanel and Azshara
* Aegis of Light could be a good choice to help with the building raid-wide damage
* SW to put a hold on stacks of Arcande damage building, and immune Arcane Detonation
* Tank swap on 24-40 stacks of debuff

## Phase 1

### Aethanel

* The fourth hit of Cold Blast will make you Frozen for 5 seconds, then nuked by Ice Shard. So use a cooldown before you get Frozen to mitigate Ice Shard if necessary.
* AS / Rebuke Chain Lightning
* Avoid Lightning Orbs

### Cyranus

* Serrated Edge bleed; dwarven racial can remove perhaps?

## Intermission 1

* Follow decrees
* Avoid soaking arcane orbs if you have Obey!

## Phase 2 (100%-70%)

* The center ward becomes the blue Ward of Power

## Phase 3

* Help soak Arcane Orbs
* Ping pong Azshara from ward to ward to ensure players can keep them charged up
