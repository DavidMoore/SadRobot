# Notable Trash

* If Dazar'ai Confessors get a Bwonsamdi's Mantle cast off, drag trash out of the bubble, as it makes their casts un-interruptible
* Interrupt Dazar'ai Augur's Fiery Enchant (exploding fire circles under party members' feet)
* For Shieldbearers of Zul, use Hammer of Justice or Blinding Light to interrupt their Bulwark of Juju
* 

# Priestess Alun'za

* Use activate mitigation, perhaps a cooldown, for Gilded Claws
* Tank her near a Tainted Blood puddle
* Step into Tainted Blood just before she casts Transfusion
* Stun and kill Spirits of Gold so they don't absorb Tainted Blood puddles. If there are no more Tainted Blood puddles, it will attack party members.
* Don't get hit by Corrupted Gold, as it will damage you and debuff you, reducing damage done by 30% for 10 seconds
* Dispel Molten Gold debuff

# Vol'kaal

* Kill all 3 totems within 6 seconds of each other, or they will heal to full
* Vol'kaal will heal himself while the totems are up, so don't bother DPSing him
* When the totems are down, Vol'kaal's health will decay, but he does 50% more damage and spews out Toxic Pools
* Interrupt Noxious Stench
* Tank him along the outside, and keep moving around to dodge the Toxic Pools so you don't run out of room and allow DPS to hit him

# Rezan

* Use active mitigation and/or cooldowns when hit by Serrated Teeth, as you bleed and take 50% additional physical damage
* Pick up Reanimated Raptor adds from Ancient Dry Bones piles
* After he casts Terrifying Visage, make sure your Divine Steed is ready to run away if he chooses to Pursue you.
* Avoid running Rezan through Ancient Dry Bones to reduce adds
* Tank him near stairs to allow people to LOS Terrifying Visage
* Healer should be ready to dispel fear from the tank if they can't LOS the fear

# Yazma

* Use active mitigation and / or cooldowns for Skewer
* Dodge Echoes of Shad'ra, or it will burst and hurt players within 3 yds and drop a pool of Shadowy Remains
* Non-tanks should move away from Yazma and ideally stack on a marked location when Soulrend is cast, allowing Soulspawn to be stunned / slowed and DPSed down before they reach Yazma
* If any Soulspawn reaches Yazma, they will add a stacking 21 second debuff that ticks on all party members
