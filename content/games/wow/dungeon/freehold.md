# Talents

Choose Blessing of Protection to put on party members if fixated by ground shark on 2nd boss (save for healer ideally)

Skycap'n Kragg

Spread from your party members, kick his healing spell. When he dismounts from his bird, the bird will come back from the edge of the arena and charge through. Try to avoid this bird.

Council o' Captains

When friendly has big barrel on his head, kill barrel, don't stand in AOE.

Ring of Booty

Catch pig, avoid turtle shurikens, when the sharknado guy throws sharks, you can kite them into the blood puddles, slowing them significantly (thanks u/boysapunk). Don't go melee range of boss when he does big tornado around him

Harlan Sweete

Don't stand in big orange bombardment, dodge stuff thrown at you. Kill the bomb add or it will chase someone and blow up (thanks u/Talehon).
