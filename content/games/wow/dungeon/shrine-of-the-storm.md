* Make sure you have Avenger's Shield ready to interrupt the Void Bolt he will cast immediately after Awaken the Void


Aqu'Sirr

Dont stand near edges, you don't wanna get knocked back and die, avoid his charge, avoid blue aoe on the ground. When he splits into 3 water elementals, try to focus fire them one by one, dont spread DPS.

Tidesage Council

Interrupt the woman as much as you can,. If you're tank and the male boss becomes very big either pop defensive CD or kite him so he doesnt hit you. They will make circles appear on the ground : one give lots of haste, other one gives lots of damage reduction when you stand in those. Go stand in those accordingly.

Lord Stormsong

Are you being Mind controlled by the boss ? If yes, go walk in dark orbs that are chasing your friends. If not, don't go walk in dark orbs that are chasing you.

Vol'zith the Whisperer

If ground is all black go away from it. Use the bonus damage / heal from the thing he casts on you to get through the phase where you're separated from team, then dispel it. Separated phase : Tank kite slow mob / heal dps slow mob / DPS interrupt tentacle mobs. Don't let adds reach boss but don't kill all adds at the same time because when they die they do damage to everyone.
