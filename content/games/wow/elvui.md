## What is ElvUI?

ElvUI is a beautiful, minimalist, highly customizable user interface suite for World of Warcraft.

I have been using ElvUI for a few years now, and would recommend it to newcomers or veterans.

## ElvUI Updater

ElvUI is not available from the Twitch add-on manager, so you normally have to download and update it yourself.

This utility will do the hard work for you by downloading the latest version of ElvUI, and installing it into your WoW addons folder.
