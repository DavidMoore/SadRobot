# Excel Tricks

## Flash Fill

Next to the column of data you're manually correcting (such as splitting full names into first and last name), make your corrections manually in the next column, select the empty rows and hit CTRL+E to Flash Fill

## Pivot Tables

## Goal Seek

For forecasting / setting targets

Data > Data Tools > What-If Analysis > Goal Seek

## Forecasting

For forecasting graphs, Data > Forecast > Forecast Sheet

## Index and Match

VLOOKUP only looks at the first column in your table; INDEX and MATCH can be used to lookup across columns
