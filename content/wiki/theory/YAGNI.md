You Aren't Gonna Need It:

This originates from eXtreme Programming (XP).

You should only add functionality until there is a need for that functionality, rather than adding
functionality you forsee as being possibly necessary later.

This helps keep the code base leaner, and allow changing requirements and refactoring.
