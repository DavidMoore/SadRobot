# Windows Maintenance

## Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool (DISM)

DISM can be used to mount and service a Windows image from a .wim file, .vhd file, or a .vhdx file or, in some cases, to update a running operating system.

You can use DISM to do various cleanup operations related to installed components, updates and service packs.

## Remove Service Pack backup components after Service Pack installation

After installing a Service Pack, you can clean up backed up components:

    dism /online /cleanup-image /spsuperseded /hidesp

Note this will make it impossible to uninstall the service pack.

## Remove all superceded components

    dism /online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup /ResetBase

This will clean up updates and service pack components, but mean you cannot uninstall Service Packs or installed Windows Updates.
